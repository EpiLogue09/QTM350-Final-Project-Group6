# QTM350-Final-Project-Group6

Welcome to the group6's final project!

Since the majority of our team members double major in a stem major and a social social sciences/humanities major, we are interested in interdisciplinary studies that have cross sections in both the field of computer science as well as that of humanities. Because of this, we decide to investigate how powerful is the Amazon Textract and how it performs when it deals with a variety of texts. We hope this project can shed some lights on its power and  facilitate more relevant studies in the future.

If you are interested in the motivations, experimental design, architecture, analysis, and any general procedures, please refer to our final project blog for more information!

* Final Project Blog: This project blog lies in the center of our project, as it contains all important materials you should know about to understand what we were doing
* ML API: This folder contains tutorial for how to use the Amazon Textract API as well as the procedure walkthrough of how we obtain the output in the analysis section
* Project Proposal: This folder contains the project's video proposal and a summary of the proposal in a pdf document
* Test-Sample: This folder contains the test samples we use for our analysis in the blog. Both handwritten and typed texts are provided for reference

If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to any of our group members!
