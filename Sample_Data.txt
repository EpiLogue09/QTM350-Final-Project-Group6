Hello, my name is Eric and I am currently a junior at Emory University, majoring in applied math and statistics. Since I was a kid, I watch my parents long and short stocks on their phone. Every now and then, they might take me out for a decent dinner when their stocks are doing well in the market. In my young ages, I see finance as a video game that grown-up plays where it fills with excitement and a certain amount of fascinating risks.

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly. If the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,
With his surcease, success, that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here —
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'd jump the life to come. 

The Pythagoras theorem states that “In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides” Or we can say: A2+B2 = C2 C = whole square root of A2+B2 B = whole square root of C2 - A2 A = whole square root of C2 - B2 Right angled = 90 degrees Hypotenuse = Side opposite to the right angle.
